After watching some demo projects from previous ECE362 students, we brainstormed and try to find a best way to use as much peripherals as possible while not too hard to finish within 4-5 weeks.

Amoung clock, car and musical instrument, we choose musical instrument. Because it use more peripherals(PWM, RTI, possibly ATD) and was not done a lot previously. It seems a ton of teams have tried clock, it's kind of hard to show creativity. Besides, cars are more of a ME project rather than ECE project, we believe.

Other than simply making a RTI based musical instrument(piano, harp, etc), we decide to put more function to it. After another round of brainstorming and discussion, we have a general idea of implementing "whack a mole" to our instrument as an instructional function, which can teach people play a song while playing the game.

title: Building Prototypes
---

After discussion, I build two prototypes.

Here is the first prototype:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prototype1.jpg)

Basically, there are three part of this "machine": one part on the top with matrix of led (3-color-led) and led screen, one part on the bottom with 5-6 hugh pushbuttom(with led inside), and the other part of menu on the left side of pushbuttoms, where the user could RESET, SELECT MODE, STOP.

This idea comes from ddr. The basic idea is that there are three modes:

**Party mode:** In this mode, all the led on top will pop different colors in turns. And if you hit different pushbuttom at the bottom, the led will change color and keep poping. I am thinking if we have time and energy, we could add some filter and with the input of sound(wave), the LEDs could light up showing the waveform.

**Game mode:** In this mode, one coloum of led will light up from top to bottom in turns, and the led in the corresponding pushbutton will light up. And if you hit the pushbuttom at the this time, the"machine" will make a sound of the corresponding pitch/note. In this way, the user could learn to play simple songs.

**Music mode:** In this mode, the user could hit any pushbuttom he/she wants and it will make a sound of corresponding pitch/note. The corresponding led will light up from bottom to top one at a time.(similar to game mode, but in a different direction).

###Some analysis:###
**Pros:** This prototype looks fancier
**Cons:** It requires a lot of work ï¼ˆthe matrix of LEDs would definitely require tons of work, and to make a song tutorial, we would need to carefully calculte the time between each note, etc)
